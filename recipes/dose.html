<h5>Description</h5>
<p>Dosa is a popular South Indian dish, known for its crispy texture and delicious taste. It's a type of thin, crepe-like pancake made from a fermented batter of rice and urad dal (black gram). Dosa is often enjoyed as a breakfast item or a snack, served hot with a variety of accompaniments such as coconut chutney, sambar (a spicy lentil soup), and potato masala (a savory potato filling).</p>
<p>The process of making dosa involves soaking rice and urad dal, grinding them into a smooth batter, and allowing it to ferment overnight. This fermentation process gives dosa its characteristic tangy flavor and makes it light and crispy. With its versatility and delightful combination of flavors, dosa has become a beloved dish not just in India but worldwide.</p>

<li>Ferment the Batter:

Transfer the batter to a large bowl, add salt, and mix thoroughly.

Heat a non-stick or cast-iron tawa (griddle) on medium heat. Lightly grease it with oil or ghee.</li>

Pour a ladleful of batter onto the hot tawa and spread it in a circular motion to form a thin, even layer.
